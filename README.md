Vue provides a way to build components that encapsulate state in your javascript in a reactive way to your HTML template using what's called Declarative rendering where you can render data to the browser with straightforward template syntax, where you can plug any variables and it gets to be rendered in the DOM, so the same data input will always produce the same output rendered in the DOM.
